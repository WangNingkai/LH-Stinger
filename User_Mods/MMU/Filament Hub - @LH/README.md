## Print

![](Assets/4.png)

:exclamation: It is highly recommended to use the print settings included in the Orca Slicer project file. There are many custom settings set per object.   

* 0.12 layer height, 0.4mm line width
* 3 perimeters, 95% infill
* Make sure your extrusion multiplier is spot on. The tolerances are very small
* Some slight post processing might be needed.
